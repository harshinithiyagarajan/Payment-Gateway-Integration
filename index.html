                  The number of children living in poverty and hunger in India could soar by millions as a result of the ongoing COVID crisis.
                A lack of access to food and the stretched health system is having a devastating effect on millions of children.<br><br>
                ragically, a significant number have lost their parents to the virus and are in need of care and protection. With their education disrupted, many children not only lack the tools to participate in online school, they are at greater risk of child labor and child marriage.
                <br><br> Our teams in India are working to protect children from exploitation, child labor and child marriage. 
                While there is more wealth in India than ever before, and significant progress has been made, it hasn’t fully translated into health care and nutrition, education or better protection for all, especially India’s most marginalized and deprived children.
                <br><br>Your donation today can help provide immediate and long-term assistance.Save the Children is working around the clock to protect children in India from harm. We are also to working to provide life-saving medical support, food and psychosocial support for children.
